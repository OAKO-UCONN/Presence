Colour-enhancing shaders for Minetest

This is my attempt at subtly improving Minetest graphics without modifying core engine code. If you have any suggestions for future improvement, feel free to contact me, as I know little about the Minetest graphics code.

## Installation
Rename the `/client/shaders` directory to something else (or delete it entirely). Then copy the `shaders` folder to the `client` folder. The shaders will take effect after leaving and rejoining the game.

## Credits
All shaders are identical to or are derivative works of the original shaders for Minetest, found [here](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/tree/master/client/shaders). All due credit goes to the original author(s) of this code.
